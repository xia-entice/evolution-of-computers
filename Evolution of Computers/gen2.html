                <p>The interest in computer technology got fast after the first-generation computers. It was the generation of Transistorized Computers. Transistors replaced vacuum tubes from the first generation computers. As a result, first-generation computers were replaced by second-generation computers. The transistors were more reliable than vacuum tubes, smaller in size, faster in speed, and cheaper than first-generation computers. Magnetic drums are replaced by magnetic disks and magnetic tape for secondary storage. As a result, the size of the machines began shrinking.  </p>

                            <p> The first relatively affordable and widely popular mainframe, the IBM 1401 Data Processing System has been called “the Model T of the computer industry.” Just as Henry Ford introduced the automobile to the masses, the IBM 1401 opened the information age to thousands of small and medium-size businesses.   
                            </br></br>
                            Introduced in 1959, the IBM 1401 quickly made inroads into the business community. By the mid-1960s, it comprised more than half of the world’s computers. The 1401 family spawned an entire generation of programmers who first learned computing on these machines. <p>

                            <p> In the midst of the 1960s, when space exploration was making headway and technological advances were shaping the future, the Control Data Corporation (CDC) unveiled a marvel of computation - the CDC 3600 supercomputer. This supercomputer was not just any piece of machinery; it played a pivotal role in post-flight data processing at NASA's Manned Space Center located near Houston, Texas.   
                            </br></br>
                            The CDC 3600 had 32,700 48-bit words of magnetic core memory and supported a FORTRAN compiler.It only had 8K words of core memory, 2 or 3 tape drives, and 2 disk drives. It also had a card reader and a drum printer. </p>

                            <p> The Honeywell 200 was a character-oriented two-address commercial computer introduced by Honeywell in December 1963, the basis of later models in Honeywell 200 Series and the character processor of the Honeywell 8200 (1968). Its memory consisted of individually addressed characters, each composed of six data bits, two punctuation bits and a parity bit.  
                            </br></br>
                            Introduced to compete with IBM's 1401, the H200 was two or three times faster and, with software support, most of the time could execute IBM 1401 programs without need for their recompilation or reassembly. </p>
