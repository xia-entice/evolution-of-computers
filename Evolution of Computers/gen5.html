                <p> Defining the fifth generation of computers is tricky because the field is still in its infancy. Tomorrowâ€™s computers would be characterized by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and ULSI (Ultra Large-Scale Integration) technology that can store millions of components in a single chip. An example of Al is Expert Systems. Computers could be developed to think and sense much the same way as humans. Computers would be able to accept verbal words as input (voice recognition). </p>
